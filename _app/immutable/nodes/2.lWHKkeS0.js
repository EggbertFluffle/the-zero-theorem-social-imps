Qohen’s name was derived from the main teacher in Ecclesiastes: Qohelet [3]. Even stronger biblical themes exist in the film, as Qohen lives inside of an old chapel he bought from an insurance company after it had suffered extensive fire damage. The general disheveled nature of the chapel and the infiltration of surveillance and work related technologies points to an absence of religion, or even further, a replacement. A perfect example sits above Qohen’s workstation: a crucifix with the decapitated head of Jesus, replaced with a surveillance camera. This holds well with some of the ideas seen in Ecclesiastes where the mantra “Hevel, hevel, everything is utterly hevel” beats. The Hebrew “hevel” is often translated as meaningless, but ironically this translation loses some of its meaning. More accurately “hevel” means “vapor” or “smoke”, suggesting that life is not meaningless, per se, but uncontrollable and disorienting. [4]</p> <p class="svelte-bkh7y3">During the story, Bainsley provides Qohen with a VR suit so that they may experience any imaginable virtual experience together. Qohen is initially reluctant to use it, but soon starts to show signs of joy while using the suit. This is contradictory to his prior behaviour, as Qohen disclosed that “we haven&#39;t felt joy in years.” We see that technology has provided Qohen with a small joy in his life full of search for that very feeling. This brings to mind an uncanny dependence on technology for any feeling at all in the man’s life. In combination with the replacement of the head of the crucifix and the countless Biblical references suggests that Rushin intended to make technology out like a religion itself. Scholars agree that technology “possesses characteristics that can be used religiously” and together with its historical origin, can “become a religion” [1]. Even if not a religion itself, at the very least the story uses Mancom’s surveillance and public presence to suggest that “technology is a threat to other religions.” [1] One example is that technology and progression in science produce results that are tangible alternatives to religious explanations of the world which typically rely on faith. Additionally technology offers tested cures or support to the sick and debilitated while religious rituals are often more symbolic in regards to these.

The film portrays intellectual work, knowledge, and thought as mere &quot;crunching entities,&quot; or pieces of data without any meaning or purpose. This shift represents a broader critique of modern systems where intellectual property is extracted from its human context, resulting in a loss of significance and fulfillment for the individual.</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">The protagonist, a highly intelligent hacker, spends his time engaged in a task that has no personal reward, no collaborative interaction, and no opportunity for genuine expression. His intellectual abilities are relegated to the service of a system that processes ideas purely for its own gain. This scenario challenges the traditional discourse on the ownership of ideas and intellectual property by highlighting a deeper issue: the devaluation of intellectual work when it becomes separated from its human purpose. In this world, even if individuals technically own their ideas, their personal connection to those ideas is gone, leaving them to serve no greater meaning beyond their functional use to “the system”.</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">The film expands on this critique by illustrating the reduction of art, science, and philosophy into numerical formulas and corporate products. In contrast to today’s intellectual property landscape, where innovation, storytelling, and self-expression hold inherent value, The Zero Theorem presents a world where these forms of intellectual work are reduced to a commodity. This difference eliminates room for exploration, beauty, or mistakes. Creativity is only allowed if it can be measured and monetized by profit-driven corporations. In this dystopian environment, intellectual property is no longer a means of personal expression or societal progress, but rather a tool for maintaining corporate power.</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">Additionally, the film criticizes the lack of shared knowledge in this world. There is no public domain—everything is transactional and locked within private systems. Ideas, truths, and scientific advancements that should be shared for the common good are instead treated as proprietary assets. The concept of the Zero Theorem itself, potentially a profound and universal idea, becomes just another corporate project, stripped of its potential for meaningful exploration. Through this lens, the film critiques a world in which the ownership of ideas is prioritized over their meaning.</p></div>';return{c(){e=f("div"),e.innerHTML=s,this.h()},l(t){e=v(t,"DIV",{id:!0,class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),_(e)!=="svelte-8nph30"&&(e.innerHTML=s),this.h()},h(){h(e,"id","intellectual-property"),h(e,"class","container svelte-1lwrkks")},m(t,i){p(t,e,i)},p:n,i:n,o:n,d(t){t&&c(e)}}}class de extends k{constructor(e){super(),b(this,e,null,ce,y,{})}}function ue(a){let e,s='<div class="content svelte-1lwrkks"><h1 class="svelte-1lwrkks">Privacy and the Government: Ch. 6</h1> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">In The Zero Theorem, the erosion of personal privacy serves as a central theme, depicting a dystopian world in which surveillance and control permeate every aspect of daily life. The film presents a society where the boundaries of privacy have dissolved, replaced by systems of constant monitoring and influence that shape the thoughts, actions, and behaviors of individuals. While traditional forms of government are absent, powerful corporate-like entities function as the de facto governing powers, using surveillance not only to observe but to manage and control the population.</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">The protagonist&#39;s life is defined by the omnipresent surveillance systems that monitor his every move. Cameras line the streets, and digital communication with supervisors is never-ending. His home, his workplace, and even his private thoughts are constantly under observation. This reflects a growing concern in our world about the power of government and corporate entities to collect and process data on individuals, often without their explicit consent or understanding. In The Zero Theorem, the loss of privacy is so ingrained that it becomes a norm. People don’t question being watched because it is simply a part of their existence.</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">More troubling is how surveillance in the film is not merely a tool for safety or regulation, it is used for social control. Through distractions like targeted advertisements, false promises of comfort, and an overwhelming flow of digital noise, the authorities keep people distracted, compliant, and dependent on the system. The film critiques the way modern technologies are used to shape society’s behaviors and beliefs. Rather than focusing on the protection of personal freedoms or the promotion of individual privacy, the surveillance mechanisms in the film are designed to prevent critical thinking, dissent, and personal autonomy. The loss of privacy is a tool to suppress individuality and keep the status quo.</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">Another significant aspect of the film’s critique is the subtlety of privacy loss. People in the world of The Zero Theorem trade their privacy for convenience, entertainment, and comfort, often without fully realizing the consequences. This mirrors contemporary debates about data collection and privacy, where individuals willingly exchange personal information for services that promise to improve their lives, whether they actually do or not. However, the film shows that this trade-off comes at the cost of personal freedom and the ability to think critically or independently.</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">The protagonist’s attempts to disconnect from the system only emphasize the futility of privacy reclamation in such a world. Even when he seeks solitude, the surveillance tools—screens, virtual assistants, and data reports—follow him, reinforcing the idea that privacy is no longer an option. This persistent intrusion symbolizes how the loss of privacy is built into the very fabric of the system, making escaping it impossible.</p></div>';return{c(){e=f("div"),e.innerHTML=s,this.h()},l(t){e=v(t,"DIV",{id:!0,class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),_(e)!=="svelte-1i23yya"&&(e.innerHTML=s),this.h()},h(){h(e,"id","privacy-and-the-government"),h(e,"class","container svelte-1lwrkks")},m(t,i){p(t,e,i)},p:n,i:n,o:n,d(t){t&&c(e)}}}class me extends k{constructor(e){super(),b(this,e,null,ue,y,{})}}function ve(a){let e,s,t,i,r,d,o,T,m,g,N,L,Z,q,O,B,j,E,F,z,D;return s=new U({}),r=new K({}),T=new he({}),g=new te({}),L=new ie({}),q=new ae({}),B=new re({}),E=new de({}),z=new me({}),{c(){e=f("main"),A(s.$$.fragment),t=H(),i=f("div"),A(r.$$.fragment),d=H(),o=f("div"),A(T.$$.fragment),m=H(),A(g.$$.fragment),N=H(),A(L.$$.fragment),Z=H(),A(q.$$.fragment),O=H(),A(B.$$.fragment),j=H(),A(E.$$.fragment),F=H(),A(z.$$.fragment),this.h()},l(l){e=v(l,"MAIN",{});var R=S(e);Q(s.$$.fragment,R),t=C(R),i=v(R,"DIV",{class:!0});var V=S(i);Q(r.$$.fragment,V),d=C(V),o=v(V,"DIV",{class:!0});var u=S(o);Q(T.$$.fragment,u),m=C(u),Q(g.$$.fragment,u),N=C(u),Q(L.$$.fragment,u),Z=C(u),Q(q.$$.fragment,u),O=C(u),Q(B.$$.fragment,u),j=C(u),Q(E.$$.fragment,u),F=C(u),Q(z.$$.fragment,u),u.forEach(c),V.forEach(c),R.forEach(c),this.h()},h(){h(o,"class","content svelte-13iyyg0"),h(i,"class","fold svelte-13iyyg0")},m(l,R){p(l,e,R),I(s,e,null),w(e,t),w(e,i),I(r,i,null),w(i,d),w(i,o),I(T,o,null),w(o,m),I(g,o,null),w(o,N),I(L,o,null),w(o,Z),I(q,o,null),w(o,O),I(B,o,null),w(o,j),I(E,o,null),w(o,F),I(z,o,null),D=!0},p:n,i(l){D||(M(s.$$.fragment,l),M(r.$$.fragment,l),M(T.$$.fragment,l),M(g.$$.fragment,l),M(L.$$.fragment,l),M(q.$$.fragment,l),M(B.$$.fragment,l),M(E.$$.fragment,l),M(z.$$.fragment,l),D=!0)},o(l){$(s.$$.fragment,l),$(r.$$.fragment,l),$(T.$$.fragment,l),$(g.$$.fragment,l),$(L.$$.fragment,l),$(q.$$.fragment,l),$(B.$$.fragment,l),$(E.$$.fragment,l),$(z.$$.fragment,l),D=!1},d(l){l&&c(e),x(s),x(r),x(T),x(g),x(L),x(q),x(B),x(E),x(z)}}}class ge extends k{constructor(e){super(),b(this,e,null,ve,y,{})}}export{ge as component};
