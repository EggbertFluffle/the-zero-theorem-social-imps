One of the most jarring examples takes place in Qohen’s own home. Camera’s are strewn around his house, but one perfectly replaces the head of the statue of Jesus Christ that hangs above his desk. This represents an omnipotent presence of surveillance, and ties with the larger motif that technology seems to replace religion, further blurring the answers to questions such as the meaning of living, and of the afterlife.</p> <p class="svelte-bkh7y3">Qohen’s name comes from the Son of David from Ecclesiastes, Qohelet, which translates in Hebrew to “One who gathers people” or more commonly “teacher”.</p>

		Some of the major messages from Qohelet of Ecclesiastes:
		<ul><li class="svelte-bkh7y3">Time will erase us all, nothing we do can stop the sun from rising and setting, and the ocean will continue to break against the beach long after we are gone. This may relate to Qohen’s appearance in the virtual world introduced to him by Bainsley. Technology has consumed him whether he would like it to or not, but the virtual world gives him a glimpse into what life would be like, had computation not taken over his life.</li> <li class="svelte-bkh7y3">Death is the great equalizer</li></ul> <em><strong>Content is not final</strong></em></div> </div> <div id="current-future-tech" class="container svelte-1lwrkks" data-svelte-h="svelte-iyloum"><div class="content svelte-1lwrkks"><h1 class="svelte-1lwrkks">Current vs. Future Tech</h1> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">Qohen’s workstation resembles a neural network–driven quantum computer, operated through immersive VR</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">The SHRINK-ROM virtual therapist is an AI-driven mental health chatbot or hologram system.</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">&quot;The Zero Theorem&quot; project itself alludes to advanced algorithmic determinism</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">In-Research or Realistic Inspirations:</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">Brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) and immersive AR/VR were in early research in 2013.</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">AI-based therapy chatbots like Woebot and virtual assistants were emerging around that time.</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">Predictive analytics and big data were growing fields, echoing the data-driven nature of Qohen’s project.</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">Old, current, exiting, fictional, in research, similar, history event dates?</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">VR experiments date back to the 1960s (Ivan Sutherland’s HMD – 1968).</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">The idea of superintelligent computers echoes  HAL 9000 (2001: A Space Odyssey, 1968) or the Matrix (1999).</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">Cloud computing (relevant to the networked nature of Qohen’s work) was a rising reality in 2013.</p> <em><strong>Content is not final</strong></em></div> </div> <div id="other-films-tech" class="container svelte-1lwrkks" data-svelte-h="svelte-gasm9t"><div class="content svelte-1lwrkks"><h1 class="svelte-1lwrkks">Technology in Other Films</h1> <h2>Older Movies:</h2> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">Brazil (1985) by the same director is a dystopian, bureaucratic tech future.</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">Tron (1982) also explores immersive digital environments, but focused on gaming</p> <h2>Newer Movies:</h2> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">Her (2013) focuses more intimately on AI relationships and natural language interfaces.</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">Ex Machina (2015) deals with AI ethics more directly</p> <em><strong>Content is not final</strong></em></div> </div> <div id="timeline" class="container svelte-msa45t" data-svelte-h="svelte-1gmiyld"><div class="content svelte-msa45t"><h1 class="svelte-msa45t">Timeline of Computing Events</h1> <ul class="svelte-msa45t"><div id="line" class="svelte-msa45t"></div> <li class="svelte-msa45t">6:02 Introduced to MANCOM, Qohen, Mr. Joby</li> <li class="svelte-msa45t">22:30 Qohen is introduced to the Neural Net and the Zero Theorem project.

The film portrays intellectual work, knowledge, and thought as mere &quot;crunching entities,&quot; or pieces of data without any meaning or purpose. This shift represents a broader critique of modern systems where intellectual property is extracted from its human context, resulting in a loss of significance and fulfillment for the individual.</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">The protagonist, a highly intelligent hacker, spends his time engaged in a task that has no personal reward, no collaborative interaction, and no opportunity for genuine expression. His intellectual abilities are relegated to the service of a system that processes ideas purely for its own gain. This scenario challenges the traditional discourse on the ownership of ideas and intellectual property by highlighting a deeper issue: the devaluation of intellectual work when it becomes separated from its human purpose. In this world, even if individuals technically own their ideas, their personal connection to those ideas is gone, leaving them to serve no greater meaning beyond their functional use to “the system”.</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">The film expands on this critique by illustrating the reduction of art, science, and philosophy into numerical formulas and corporate products. In contrast to today’s intellectual property landscape, where innovation, storytelling, and self-expression hold inherent value, The Zero Theorem presents a world where these forms of intellectual work are reduced to a commodity. This difference eliminates room for exploration, beauty, or mistakes. Creativity is only allowed if it can be measured and monetized by profit-driven corporations. In this dystopian environment, intellectual property is no longer a means of personal expression or societal progress, but rather a tool for maintaining corporate power.</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">Additionally, the film criticizes the lack of shared knowledge in this world. There is no public domain—everything is transactional and locked within private systems. Ideas, truths, and scientific advancements that should be shared for the common good are instead treated as proprietary assets. The concept of the Zero Theorem itself, potentially a profound and universal idea, becomes just another corporate project, stripped of its potential for meaningful exploration. Through this lens, the film critiques a world in which the ownership of ideas is prioritized over their meaning.</p></div> </div> <div id="privacy-and-the-government" class="container svelte-1lwrkks" data-svelte-h="svelte-1i23yya"><div class="content svelte-1lwrkks"><h1 class="svelte-1lwrkks">Privacy and the Government: Ch. 6</h1> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">In The Zero Theorem, the erosion of personal privacy serves as a central theme, depicting a dystopian world in which surveillance and control permeate every aspect of daily life. The film presents a society where the boundaries of privacy have dissolved, replaced by systems of constant monitoring and influence that shape the thoughts, actions, and behaviors of individuals. While traditional forms of government are absent, powerful corporate-like entities function as the de facto governing powers, using surveillance not only to observe but to manage and control the population.</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">The protagonist&#39;s life is defined by the omnipresent surveillance systems that monitor his every move. Cameras line the streets, and digital communication with supervisors is never-ending. His home, his workplace, and even his private thoughts are constantly under observation. This reflects a growing concern in our world about the power of government and corporate entities to collect and process data on individuals, often without their explicit consent or understanding. In The Zero Theorem, the loss of privacy is so ingrained that it becomes a norm. People don’t question being watched because it is simply a part of their existence.</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">More troubling is how surveillance in the film is not merely a tool for safety or regulation, it is used for social control. Through distractions like targeted advertisements, false promises of comfort, and an overwhelming flow of digital noise, the authorities keep people distracted, compliant, and dependent on the system. The film critiques the way modern technologies are used to shape society’s behaviors and beliefs. Rather than focusing on the protection of personal freedoms or the promotion of individual privacy, the surveillance mechanisms in the film are designed to prevent critical thinking, dissent, and personal autonomy. The loss of privacy is a tool to suppress individuality and keep the status quo.</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">Another significant aspect of the film’s critique is the subtlety of privacy loss. People in the world of The Zero Theorem trade their privacy for convenience, entertainment, and comfort, often without fully realizing the consequences. This mirrors contemporary debates about data collection and privacy, where individuals willingly exchange personal information for services that promise to improve their lives, whether they actually do or not. However, the film shows that this trade-off comes at the cost of personal freedom and the ability to think critically or independently.</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">The protagonist’s attempts to disconnect from the system only emphasize the futility of privacy reclamation in such a world. Even when he seeks solitude, the surveillance tools—screens, virtual assistants, and data reports—follow him, reinforcing the idea that privacy is no longer an option. This persistent intrusion symbolizes how the loss of privacy is built into the very fabric of the system, making escaping it impossible.</p></div> </div></div></div> </main>
