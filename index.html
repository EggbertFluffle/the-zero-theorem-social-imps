Qohen’s name was derived from the main teacher in Ecclesiastes: Qohelet [3]. Even stronger biblical themes exist in the film, as Qohen lives inside of an old chapel he bought from an insurance company after it had suffered extensive fire damage. The general disheveled nature of the chapel and the infiltration of surveillance and work related technologies points to an absence of religion, or even further, a replacement. A perfect example sits above Qohen’s workstation: a crucifix with the decapitated head of Jesus, replaced with a surveillance camera. This holds well with some of the ideas seen in Ecclesiastes where the mantra “Hevel, hevel, everything is utterly hevel” beats. The Hebrew “hevel” is often translated as meaningless, but ironically this translation loses some of its meaning. More accurately “hevel” means “vapor” or “smoke”, suggesting that life is not meaningless, per se, but uncontrollable and disorienting. [4]</p> <p class="svelte-bkh7y3">During the story, Bainsley provides Qohen with a VR suit so that they may experience any imaginable virtual experience together. Qohen is initially reluctant to use it, but soon starts to show signs of joy while using the suit. This is contradictory to his prior behaviour, as Qohen disclosed that “we haven&#39;t felt joy in years.” We see that technology has provided Qohen with a small joy in his life full of search for that very feeling. This brings to mind an uncanny dependence on technology for any feeling at all in the man’s life. In combination with the replacement of the head of the crucifix and the countless Biblical references suggests that Rushin intended to make technology out like a religion itself. Scholars agree that technology “possesses characteristics that can be used religiously” and together with its historical origin, can “become a religion” [1]. Even if not a religion itself, at the very least the story uses Mancom’s surveillance and public presence to suggest that “technology is a threat to other religions.” [1] One example is that technology and progression in science produce results that are tangible alternatives to religious explanations of the world which typically rely on faith. Additionally technology offers tested cures or support to the sick and debilitated while religious rituals are often more symbolic in regards to these.

The film constructs a future where technology is integrated into every aspect of life—from work and relationships to therapy and spirituality—shaping the way people think, feel, and interact. Rather than being a tool to aid human progress, technology becomes a substitute for genuine connection, fulfillment, and meaning.</p> <p class="svelte-bkh7y3">The society in the film is designed around digital infrastructure, where the virtual often takes priority over the real. People walk through neon-lit streets completely absorbed in screens, oblivious to their physical surroundings. Even interpersonal relationships are mediated through virtual platforms. For example, Qohen’s most emotionally significant connection is with Bainsley, yet their relationship unfolds primarily in a simulated beach world—a virtual reality environment designed for comfort, not authenticity. The fact that their bond feels real to Qohen despite the artificiality of their interactions highlights just how deeply people in this world have come to rely on technology for emotional fulfillment. Even more so when Bainsley tries to make a connection with Qohen in reality, he feels betrayed and scared and turns her down.</p> <p class="svelte-bkh7y3">Technology also replaces traditional sources of existential meaning. Qohen, who is searching for a sign from “the phone call” (a metaphor for divine purpose or truth), waits endlessly for a literal phone to ring. His spiritual anxiety is filtered through a technological interface. Likewise, his therapy sessions are conducted by SHRINK-ROM, an AI program that uses pre-scripted interactions to address complex human emotions. These depersonalized encounters underscore how technology is used as a coping mechanism, promising quick solutions to psychological and philosophical dilemmas.</p> <p class="svelte-bkh7y3">More than a convenience, technology in The Zero Theorem becomes a crutch—something people cling to because they no longer trust or know how to function without it. This dependency is encouraged by systems of power like Mancom, which use technology to both pacify and control. Work becomes a form of meaningless digital labor; entertainment becomes a constant distraction; therapy becomes an algorithm. The tools that were meant to liberate instead confine, offering simulated satisfaction while reducing the individual’s ability to think critically or act independently.</p> <p class="svelte-bkh7y3">What makes this portrayal especially relevant is the subtlety of the control. People don’t realize they’re dependent on these systems because they’ve been integrated into every part of life. Technology promises ease, comfort, and connection—but the film reveals that this promise masks a deeper emptiness. The characters, especially Qohen, experience profound isolation and confusion despite (or because of) their constant digital engagement. They have traded human connection for technological simulation and lost something vital in the process.</p> <p class="svelte-bkh7y3">Qohen’s increasing retreat into the virtual world is not just escapism—it is resignation. Unable to find meaning or connection in the physical world, he chooses to live inside a digital illusion, where he can at least control the environment. This final act illustrates the ultimate danger of technological dependence: it can lead individuals to abandon reality altogether. In the film’s closing moments, Qohen appears to find peace, but it is a peace built on disconnection, solitude, and unreality—a silent commentary on what happens when people rely too heavily on technology to fill the voids in their lives.</p> <p class="svelte-bkh7y3">Ultimately, The Zero Theorem offers a bleak but powerful warning. Human dependence on technology, while often convenient or even comforting, comes with hidden costs. As people trade genuine experiences for artificial ones, and authentic emotion for programmed responses, they risk losing their autonomy, their relationships, and their sense of self. The film challenges viewers to reflect on the role technology plays in their own lives—and whether they’re still in control of it, or whether it’s already in control of them.</p> <ol><li class="svelte-bkh7y3">Andrew Perrin And Sara Atske, About three-in-ten U.S. adults say they are ‘almost constantly’ online (The Pew Research Center, 3-29-2021), <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/03/26/about-three-in-ten-u-s-adults-say-they-are-almost-constantly-online/">https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/03/26/about-three-in-ten-u-s-adults-say-they-are-almost-constantly-online/</a> (Accessed 05-06-2025)</li> <li class="svelte-bkh7y3">James Sherer, What is Technology Addiction?

Cameras line the streets, his home, and digital communication with supervisors is never-ending. This reflects a growing concern in our world about the power of government and corporate entities to collect and process data on individuals, often without their explicit consent or understanding. In The Zero Theorem, the loss of privacy is so ingrained that it becomes a norm. People don’t question being watched because it is simply a part of their existence.</p> <p class="svelte-1nbjybq">More troubling is how surveillance in the film is not merely a tool for safety or regulation, it is used for social control and manipulation. Through distractions like targeted advertisements, false promises of comfort, and an overwhelming flow of digital noise, the authorities keep people distracted, compliant, and dependent on the system. The film critiques the way modern technologies are used to shape society’s behaviors and beliefs. Rather than focusing on the protection of personal freedoms or the promotion of individual privacy, the surveillance mechanisms in the film are designed to prevent critical thinking, dissent, and personal autonomy. The loss of privacy is a tool to suppress individuality and keep the status quo.</p> <p class="svelte-1nbjybq">The protagonist’s attempts to disconnect from the system only emphasize the futility of privacy reclamation in such a world. Even when he seeks solitude, the surveillance tools—screens, virtual assistants, and data reports—follow him, reinforcing the idea that privacy is no longer an option. This persistent intrusion symbolizes how the loss of privacy is built into the very fabric of the system, making escaping it impossible.</p> <h2>Act Utilitarian Analysis</h2> <p class="svelte-1nbjybq">So we can see that surveillance is unpleasant - but let’s take a look at it through the lens of one of our ethical frameworks.</p> <h3>Stakeholders:</h3> <ol><li class="svelte-1nbjybq">Quohen (the surveilled subject)</li> <li class="svelte-1nbjybq">Management (the surveilling party)</li> <li class="svelte-1nbjybq">Society at large</li> <li class="svelte-1nbjybq">Other workers/individuals under similar surveillance</li> <li class="svelte-1nbjybq">Viewers</li></ol> <h3>Short-term benefits:</h3> <ol><li class="svelte-1nbjybq">Management gains control over labor efficiency and psychological metrics</li> <li class="svelte-1nbjybq">Society appears orderly and stable under constant oversight</li> <li class="svelte-1nbjybq">Problems can be identified and managed quickly</li></ol> <h3>Long-term harms:</h3> <ol><li class="svelte-1nbjybq">Individuals experience emotional and psychological strain due to lack of privacy and autonomy</li> <li class="svelte-1nbjybq">Normalization of invasive surveillance leads to societal complacency and erosion of civil liberties</li> <li class="svelte-1nbjybq">People, like Quohen, feel trapped, isolated, and dehumanized</li> <li class="svelte-1nbjybq">Genuine innovation, trust, and creativity are stifled as people conform to monitored expectations</li> <li class="svelte-1nbjybq">The manipulation of private data for control undermines dignity and freedom</li></ol> <h3>Conclusion</h3> <p class="svelte-1nbjybq">Net utility loss: system results in despair rather than progress: unethical</p> <br> <ol><li class="svelte-1nbjybq">Zuboff, Shoshana.

The film portrays intellectual work, knowledge, and thought as mere &quot;crunching entities,&quot; or pieces of data without any meaning or purpose. This shift represents a broader critique of modern systems where intellectual property is extracted from its human context, resulting in a loss of significance and fulfillment for the individual.</p> <p class="svelte-1nbjybq">The protagonist, a highly intelligent hacker, spends his time engaged in a task that has no personal reward, no collaborative interaction, and no opportunity for genuine expression. His intellectual abilities are relegated to the service of a system that processes ideas purely for its own gain. This scenario challenges the traditional discourse on the ownership of ideas and intellectual property by highlighting a deeper issue: the devaluation of intellectual work when it becomes separated from its human purpose. In this world, even if individuals technically own their ideas, their personal connection to those ideas is gone, leaving them to serve no greater meaning beyond their functional use to “the system”.</p> <p class="svelte-1nbjybq">The film expands on this critique by illustrating the reduction of art, science, and philosophy into numerical formulas and corporate products. In contrast to today’s intellectual property landscape, where innovation, storytelling, and self-expression hold inherent value, The Zero Theorem presents a world where these forms of intellectual work are reduced to a commodity. This difference eliminates room for exploration, beauty, or mistakes. Creativity is only allowed if it can be measured and monetized by profit-driven corporations. In this dystopian environment, intellectual property is no longer a means of personal expression or societal progress, but rather a tool for maintaining corporate power.</p> <p class="svelte-1nbjybq">Additionally, the film criticizes the lack of shared knowledge in this world. There is no public domain—everything is transactional and locked within private systems. Ideas, truths, and scientific advancements that should be shared for the common good are instead treated as proprietary assets. The concept of the Zero Theorem itself, potentially a profound and universal idea, becomes just another corporate project, stripped of its potential for meaningful exploration. Through this lens, the film critiques a world in which the ownership of ideas is prioritized over their meaning.</p></div> <ol><li class="svelte-1nbjybq">Papaioannou, Theodoros. &quot;Towards a Critique of the Moral Foundations of Intellectual Property Rights.&quot; Journal of Global Ethics, vol. 2, no. 1, 2006, pp. 67–90.

One of the characters, Bob, is a child prodigy who is implied to be much smarter than Qohen is. The only reason he hasn’t attempted the Zero Theorem is because he’s nobody’s tool. This follows Bob’s carefree attitude at first glance, but upon further inspection this spells out the message the movie is trying to tell, which is that the meaning of life is dependant on how it is lived. By saying that he isn’t a tool he says that his life is his to live. Management, on the other hand, has a complete opposite philosophy. He uses the Shrink-ROM to monitor him and the VR suit to manipulate him. He plans to use the Zero Theorem and the Neural Net Mancrive to cause chaos in the general public that will make him money. The movie makes no mistake in labeling him as the villain through this negative imagery. Management completely disregards what might be good for any of the other characters in the movie, caring only for what makes him money. Management’s image and goals oppose the Kantian belief that people aren’t a means to an end. In this way, The Zero Theorem leans toward a Kantian perspective of freedom away from unempathetic corporations.</p></div> </div> <div id="networked-communications" class="container svelte-1lwrkks" data-svelte-h="svelte-1h5iumu"><div class="content svelte-1lwrkks"><h1 class="svelte-1lwrkks">Networked Communications: Ch. 3</h1> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks"><em>The Zero Theorem</em> presents a dystopian vision of networked communication that reflects many of the ethical concerns raised in Chapter 3.

Qohen receives messages and virtual interactions not to foster connection, but to pacify and manipulate him - which echoes concerns about digital tools being used for manipulation and control, rather than help.</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">Qohen’s data is constantly monitored, and digital environments are tightly controlled by corporate systems, similar to how repressive governments filter online content or monitor activity for conformity. There is no freedom of expression in this world, only an illusion.</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">The Zero Theorem also touches on the topic of dependence - Quohen’s deteriorating mental state causes him to become more and more dependent on the VR device, with hints that he becomes trapped in a VR world at the end.</p></div> </div> <div id="intellectual-property" class="container svelte-1lwrkks" data-svelte-h="svelte-8nph30"><div class="content svelte-1lwrkks"><h1 class="svelte-1lwrkks">Intellectual Property: Ch. 4</h1> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">The Zero Theorem provides commentary on the commodification of intellectual property by depicting a world where creativity is stripped of its intrinsic value and repurposed for corporate interests. The film portrays intellectual work, knowledge, and thought as mere &quot;crunching entities,&quot; or pieces of data without any meaning or purpose. This shift represents a broader critique of modern systems where intellectual property is extracted from its human context, resulting in a loss of significance and fulfillment for the individual.</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">The protagonist, a highly intelligent hacker, spends his time engaged in a task that has no personal reward, no collaborative interaction, and no opportunity for genuine expression. His intellectual abilities are relegated to the service of a system that processes ideas purely for its own gain. This scenario challenges the traditional discourse on the ownership of ideas and intellectual property by highlighting a deeper issue: the devaluation of intellectual work when it becomes separated from its human purpose. In this world, even if individuals technically own their ideas, their personal connection to those ideas is gone, leaving them to serve no greater meaning beyond their functional use to “the system”.</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">The film expands on this critique by illustrating the reduction of art, science, and philosophy into numerical formulas and corporate products. In contrast to today’s intellectual property landscape, where innovation, storytelling, and self-expression hold inherent value, The Zero Theorem presents a world where these forms of intellectual work are reduced to a commodity. This difference eliminates room for exploration, beauty, or mistakes. Creativity is only allowed if it can be measured and monetized by profit-driven corporations. In this dystopian environment, intellectual property is no longer a means of personal expression or societal progress, but rather a tool for maintaining corporate power.</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">Additionally, the film criticizes the lack of shared knowledge in this world. There is no public domain—everything is transactional and locked within private systems. Ideas, truths, and scientific advancements that should be shared for the common good are instead treated as proprietary assets. The concept of the Zero Theorem itself, potentially a profound and universal idea, becomes just another corporate project, stripped of its potential for meaningful exploration. Through this lens, the film critiques a world in which the ownership of ideas is prioritized over their meaning.</p></div> </div> <div id="information-privacy" class="container svelte-1lwrkks" data-svelte-h="svelte-i4u10z"><div class="content svelte-1lwrkks"><h1 class="svelte-1lwrkks">Information Privacy: Ch. 5</h1> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks"><em>The Zero Theorem</em> presents a world where privacy has eroded to the point of nonexistence. The protagonist, Qohen, is constantly monitored by corporate systems, with no real control over who collects or sees his personal data.</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">In the film, Qohen is bombarded with ads and messages tailored to his personal anxieties. There is no privacy in this system - just an endless stream of data-driven manipulation designed to extract value from him.</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">The film also touches on the topic of personal privacy: Qohen’s environment denies him personal information control entirely. Everything from his medical records to his thoughts are accessible to the corporation that employs him.</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks"><em>The Zero Theorem</em> explores what happens when the agreement of privacy being a prudential right breaks down. Without privacy, there is no individuality or dignity left, but data, and the systems that exploit it.</p></div> </div> <div id="privacy-and-the-government" class="container svelte-1lwrkks" data-svelte-h="svelte-1i23yya"><div class="content svelte-1lwrkks"><h1 class="svelte-1lwrkks">Privacy and the Government: Ch. 6</h1> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">In The Zero Theorem, the erosion of personal privacy serves as a central theme, depicting a dystopian world in which surveillance and control permeate every aspect of daily life. The film presents a society where the boundaries of privacy have dissolved, replaced by systems of constant monitoring and influence that shape the thoughts, actions, and behaviors of individuals. While traditional forms of government are absent, powerful corporate-like entities function as the de facto governing powers, using surveillance not only to observe but to manage and control the population.</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">The protagonist&#39;s life is defined by the omnipresent surveillance systems that monitor his every move. Cameras line the streets, and digital communication with supervisors is never-ending. His home, his workplace, and even his private thoughts are constantly under observation. This reflects a growing concern in our world about the power of government and corporate entities to collect and process data on individuals, often without their explicit consent or understanding. In The Zero Theorem, the loss of privacy is so ingrained that it becomes a norm. People don’t question being watched because it is simply a part of their existence.</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">More troubling is how surveillance in the film is not merely a tool for safety or regulation, it is used for social control. Through distractions like targeted advertisements, false promises of comfort, and an overwhelming flow of digital noise, the authorities keep people distracted, compliant, and dependent on the system. The film critiques the way modern technologies are used to shape society’s behaviors and beliefs. Rather than focusing on the protection of personal freedoms or the promotion of individual privacy, the surveillance mechanisms in the film are designed to prevent critical thinking, dissent, and personal autonomy. The loss of privacy is a tool to suppress individuality and keep the status quo.</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">Another significant aspect of the film’s critique is the subtlety of privacy loss. People in the world of The Zero Theorem trade their privacy for convenience, entertainment, and comfort, often without fully realizing the consequences. This mirrors contemporary debates about data collection and privacy, where individuals willingly exchange personal information for services that promise to improve their lives, whether they actually do or not. However, the film shows that this trade-off comes at the cost of personal freedom and the ability to think critically or independently.</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">The protagonist’s attempts to disconnect from the system only emphasize the futility of privacy reclamation in such a world. Even when he seeks solitude, the surveillance tools—screens, virtual assistants, and data reports—follow him, reinforcing the idea that privacy is no longer an option. This persistent intrusion symbolizes how the loss of privacy is built into the very fabric of the system, making escaping it impossible.</p></div> </div> <div id="network-security" class="container svelte-1lwrkks" data-svelte-h="svelte-1eita0z"><div class="content svelte-1lwrkks"><h1 class="svelte-1lwrkks">Computer and Network Security: Ch. 7</h1> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">During the film, security regarding the network of computers is not mentioned directly, but it seems that MANCOM has some level of control over Qohen’s home machine which he uses to crunch entities. The corporation is seen sending Qohen pop-ups, voice messages, phone calls and the like in order to invade his privacy even further and pester him into making progress on the zero theorem. This example is questionably related to the security of networks as we can infer that Qohen either willingly allowed this sort of software onto his computer or the computer itself was company supplied. This would then morph from a computer or network vulnerability into a simple but gross invasion of the main character’s privacy.</p></div> </div> <div id="computer-reliability" class="container svelte-1lwrkks" data-svelte-h="svelte-1rtru7v"><div class="content svelte-1lwrkks"><h1 class="svelte-1lwrkks">Computer Reliability: Ch. 8</h1> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">The Zero Theorem steers away from technologies that bring up the reliability of computer systems. The closest to computer unreliability we see is Qohen wrecking the monitor he uses at home and his wrecking the Neural Net Mancrive. These are both due to human intervention and intentional destruction. The chapter is largely focused on untested hardware and bugs in production software. One could be led to believe that the SHRINK-ROM is buggy software but it is later revealed that the SHRINK-ROM did not have a glitch as she may have claimed, but instead was being reprogrammed to manipulate Qohen.</p></div> </div> <div id="globalization-automation" class="container svelte-1lwrkks" data-svelte-h="svelte-xmcg4x"><div class="content svelte-1lwrkks"><h1 class="svelte-1lwrkks">Globalization and Automation: Ch. 10</h1> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">In the film, the ideas presented in the chapter on automation and globalization, present themselves in subtle ways. Not shown at a large scale, Qohenis given a “SHRINK-ROM” supplied by MANCOM which acts as a psychological outlet for him. At first it seems as if the SHRINK-ROM has good intentions, but it is later revealed that through MANCOM’s control the SHRINK-ROM has been feeding Qohen lies about the status of his call, and trying to ensure he can work efficiently on the Zero Theorem.</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">In this way we see a very obvious problem with the automation of uniquely human positions. First the SHRINK-ROM is particularly ineffective when helping Qohen, and doesn’t seem to make any progress in helping his mental state. That being said, it was programmed with a bias to lure Qohen into MANCOM’s clutches, but even so, Qohen’s mental state is particularly terrible, even without knowledge of what exact problems he might be facing, and it’s clear that there needs to be more than surface level examination on his emotions.</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">Automation will always occur, and is almost unavoidable but it is in the best interest of our society to consider what ought to and ought not to become automated. Mental health professionals are a great example which often require a unique human understanding.</p></div> </div></div></div> </main>
