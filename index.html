Qohen’s name was derived from the main teacher in Ecclesiastes: Qohelet [3]. Even stronger biblical themes exist in the film, as Qohen lives inside of an old chapel he bought from an insurance company after it had suffered extensive fire damage. The general disheveled nature of the chapel and the infiltration of surveillance and work related technologies points to an absence of religion, or even further, a replacement. A perfect example sits above Qohen’s workstation: a crucifix with the decapitated head of Jesus, replaced with a surveillance camera. This holds well with some of the ideas seen in Ecclesiastes where the mantra “Hevel, hevel, everything is utterly hevel” beats. The Hebrew “hevel” is often translated as meaningless, but ironically this translation loses some of its meaning. More accurately “hevel” means “vapor” or “smoke”, suggesting that life is not meaningless, per se, but uncontrollable and disorienting. [4]</p> <p class="svelte-bkh7y3">During the story, Bainsley provides Qohen with a VR suit so that they may experience any imaginable virtual experience together. Qohen is initially reluctant to use it, but soon starts to show signs of joy while using the suit. This is contradictory to his prior behaviour, as Qohen disclosed that “we haven&#39;t felt joy in years.” We see that technology has provided Qohen with a small joy in his life full of search for that very feeling. This brings to mind an uncanny dependence on technology for any feeling at all in the man’s life. In combination with the replacement of the head of the crucifix and the countless Biblical references suggests that Rushin intended to make technology out like a religion itself. Scholars agree that technology “possesses characteristics that can be used religiously” and together with its historical origin, can “become a religion” [1]. Even if not a religion itself, at the very least the story uses Mancom’s surveillance and public presence to suggest that “technology is a threat to other religions.” [1] One example is that technology and progression in science produce results that are tangible alternatives to religious explanations of the world which typically rely on faith. Additionally technology offers tested cures or support to the sick and debilitated while religious rituals are often more symbolic in regards to these.

The film constructs a future where technology is integrated into every aspect of life—from work and relationships to therapy and spirituality—shaping the way people think, feel, and interact. Rather than being a tool to aid human progress, technology becomes a substitute for genuine connection, fulfillment, and meaning.</p> <p class="svelte-bkh7y3">The society in the film is designed around digital infrastructure, where the virtual often takes priority over the real. People walk through neon-lit streets completely absorbed in screens, oblivious to their physical surroundings. Even interpersonal relationships are mediated through virtual platforms. For example, Qohen’s most emotionally significant connection is with Bainsley, yet their relationship unfolds primarily in a simulated beach world—a virtual reality environment designed for comfort, not authenticity. The fact that their bond feels real to Qohen despite the artificiality of their interactions highlights just how deeply people in this world have come to rely on technology for emotional fulfillment. Even more so when Bainsley tries to make a connection with Qohen in reality, he feels betrayed and scared and turns her down.</p> <p class="svelte-bkh7y3">Technology also replaces traditional sources of existential meaning. Qohen, who is searching for a sign from “the phone call” (a metaphor for divine purpose or truth), waits endlessly for a literal phone to ring. His spiritual anxiety is filtered through a technological interface. Likewise, his therapy sessions are conducted by SHRINK-ROM, an AI program that uses pre-scripted interactions to address complex human emotions. These depersonalized encounters underscore how technology is used as a coping mechanism, promising quick solutions to psychological and philosophical dilemmas.</p> <p class="svelte-bkh7y3">More than a convenience, technology in The Zero Theorem becomes a crutch—something people cling to because they no longer trust or know how to function without it. This dependency is encouraged by systems of power like Mancom, which use technology to both pacify and control. Work becomes a form of meaningless digital labor; entertainment becomes a constant distraction; therapy becomes an algorithm. The tools that were meant to liberate instead confine, offering simulated satisfaction while reducing the individual’s ability to think critically or act independently.</p> <p class="svelte-bkh7y3">What makes this portrayal especially relevant is the subtlety of the control. People don’t realize they’re dependent on these systems because they’ve been integrated into every part of life. Technology promises ease, comfort, and connection—but the film reveals that this promise masks a deeper emptiness. The characters, especially Qohen, experience profound isolation and confusion despite (or because of) their constant digital engagement. They have traded human connection for technological simulation and lost something vital in the process.</p> <p class="svelte-bkh7y3">Qohen’s increasing retreat into the virtual world is not just escapism—it is resignation. Unable to find meaning or connection in the physical world, he chooses to live inside a digital illusion, where he can at least control the environment. This final act illustrates the ultimate danger of technological dependence: it can lead individuals to abandon reality altogether. In the film’s closing moments, Qohen appears to find peace, but it is a peace built on disconnection, solitude, and unreality—a silent commentary on what happens when people rely too heavily on technology to fill the voids in their lives.</p> <p class="svelte-bkh7y3">Ultimately, The Zero Theorem offers a bleak but powerful warning. Human dependence on technology, while often convenient or even comforting, comes with hidden costs. As people trade genuine experiences for artificial ones, and authentic emotion for programmed responses, they risk losing their autonomy, their relationships, and their sense of self. The film challenges viewers to reflect on the role technology plays in their own lives—and whether they’re still in control of it, or whether it’s already in control of them.</p> <ol><li class="svelte-bkh7y3">Andrew Perrin And Sara Atske, About three-in-ten U.S. adults say they are ‘almost constantly’ online (The Pew Research Center, 3-29-2021), <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/03/26/about-three-in-ten-u-s-adults-say-they-are-almost-constantly-online/">https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/03/26/about-three-in-ten-u-s-adults-say-they-are-almost-constantly-online/</a> (Accessed 05-06-2025)</li> <li class="svelte-bkh7y3">James Sherer, What is Technology Addiction?

This reflects a growing concern in our world about the power of government and corporate entities to collect and process data on individuals, often without their explicit consent or understanding. In The Zero Theorem, the loss of privacy is so ingrained that it becomes a norm. People don’t question being watched because it is simply a part of their existence.</p> <p class="svelte-1nbjybq">More troubling is how surveillance in the film is not merely a tool for safety or regulation, it is used for social control and manipulation. Through distractions like targeted advertisements, false promises of comfort, and an overwhelming flow of digital noise, the authorities keep people distracted, compliant, and dependent on the system. The film critiques the way modern technologies are used to shape society’s behaviors and beliefs. Rather than focusing on the protection of personal freedoms or the promotion of individual privacy, the surveillance mechanisms in the film are designed to prevent critical thinking, dissent, and personal autonomy. The loss of privacy is a tool to suppress individuality and keep the status quo.</p> <p class="svelte-1nbjybq">The protagonist’s attempts to disconnect from the system only emphasize the futility of privacy reclamation in such a world. Even when he seeks solitude, the surveillance tools—screens, virtual assistants, and data reports—follow him, reinforcing the idea that privacy is no longer an option. This persistent intrusion symbolizes how the loss of privacy is built into the very fabric of the system, making escaping it impossible.</p> <h2>Act Utilitarian Analysis</h2> <p class="svelte-1nbjybq">So we can see that surveillance is unpleasant - but let’s take a look at it through the lens of one of our ethical frameworks.</p> <h3>Stakeholders:</h3> <ol><li class="svelte-1nbjybq">Quohen (the surveilled subject)</li> <li class="svelte-1nbjybq">Management (the surveilling party)</li> <li class="svelte-1nbjybq">Society at large</li> <li class="svelte-1nbjybq">Other workers/individuals under similar surveillance</li> <li class="svelte-1nbjybq">Viewers</li></ol> <h3>Short-term benefits:</h3> <ol><li class="svelte-1nbjybq">Management gains control over labor efficiency and psychological metrics</li> <li class="svelte-1nbjybq">Society appears orderly and stable under constant oversight</li> <li class="svelte-1nbjybq">Problems can be identified and managed quickly</li></ol> <h3>Long-term harms:</h3> <ol><li class="svelte-1nbjybq">Individuals experience emotional and psychological strain due to lack of privacy and autonomy</li> <li class="svelte-1nbjybq">Normalization of invasive surveillance leads to societal complacency and erosion of civil liberties</li> <li class="svelte-1nbjybq">People, like Quohen, feel trapped, isolated, and dehumanized</li> <li class="svelte-1nbjybq">Genuine innovation, trust, and creativity are stifled as people conform to monitored expectations</li> <li class="svelte-1nbjybq">The manipulation of private data for control undermines dignity and freedom</li></ol> <h3>Conclusion</h3> <p class="svelte-1nbjybq">Net utility loss: system results in despair rather than progress: unethical</p></div> </div> <div id="intellectual-commodity" class="container svelte-1fsvdhr" data-svelte-h="svelte-er5dm6"><div class="content svelte-1fsvdhr"><h1 class="svelte-1fsvdhr">Intellectual Property made a Commodity</h1> <p class="svelte-1fsvdhr">The Zero Theorem provides commentary on the commodification of intellectual property by depicting a world where creativity is stripped of its intrinsic value and repurposed for corporate interests.

One of the characters, Bob, is a child prodigy who is implied to be much smarter than Qohen is. The only reason he hasn’t attempted the Zero Theorem is because he’s nobody’s tool. This follows Bob’s carefree attitude at first glance, but upon further inspection this spells out the message the movie is trying to tell, which is that the meaning of life is dependant on how it is lived. By saying that he isn’t a tool he says that his life is his to live. Management, on the other hand, has a complete opposite philosophy. He uses the Shrink-ROM to monitor him and the VR suit to manipulate him. He plans to use the Zero Theorem and the Neural Net Mancrive to cause chaos in the general public that will make him money. The movie makes no mistake in labeling him as the villain through this negative imagery. Management completely disregards what might be good for any of the other characters in the movie, caring only for what makes him money. Management’s image and goals oppose the Kantian belief that people aren’t a means to an end. In this way, The Zero Theorem leans toward a Kantian perspective of freedom away from unempathetic corporations.</p></div> </div> <div id="intellectual-property" class="container svelte-1lwrkks" data-svelte-h="svelte-8nph30"><div class="content svelte-1lwrkks"><h1 class="svelte-1lwrkks">Intellectual Property: Ch. 4</h1> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">The Zero Theorem provides commentary on the commodification of intellectual property by depicting a world where creativity is stripped of its intrinsic value and repurposed for corporate interests.

Through distractions like targeted advertisements, false promises of comfort, and an overwhelming flow of digital noise, the authorities keep people distracted, compliant, and dependent on the system. The film critiques the way modern technologies are used to shape society’s behaviors and beliefs. Rather than focusing on the protection of personal freedoms or the promotion of individual privacy, the surveillance mechanisms in the film are designed to prevent critical thinking, dissent, and personal autonomy. The loss of privacy is a tool to suppress individuality and keep the status quo.</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">Another significant aspect of the film’s critique is the subtlety of privacy loss. People in the world of The Zero Theorem trade their privacy for convenience, entertainment, and comfort, often without fully realizing the consequences. This mirrors contemporary debates about data collection and privacy, where individuals willingly exchange personal information for services that promise to improve their lives, whether they actually do or not. However, the film shows that this trade-off comes at the cost of personal freedom and the ability to think critically or independently.</p> <p class="svelte-1lwrkks">The protagonist’s attempts to disconnect from the system only emphasize the futility of privacy reclamation in such a world. Even when he seeks solitude, the surveillance tools—screens, virtual assistants, and data reports—follow him, reinforcing the idea that privacy is no longer an option. This persistent intrusion symbolizes how the loss of privacy is built into the very fabric of the system, making escaping it impossible.</p></div> </div></div></div> </main>
